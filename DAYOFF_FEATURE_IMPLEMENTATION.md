# 🚫 DAY-OFF FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & TESTED  
**Feature:** Stop Routine on Day-offs Setting

## 🎯 FEATURE OVERVIEW
Implemented a "Stop Routine on Day-offs" toggle that allows users to hide all routine actions on their selected day-off days. When this setting is ON, selected day-off days will show no routine actions in the timeline.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 🔧 Core Logic Location
**File:** `lib/main_checkpoint8_final.dart`  
**Method:** `_initializeDisplayActions()` (Lines ~4213-4225)  

```dart
// DAY-OFF LOGIC: Hide all routine actions on selected day-offs if setting is ON
if (widget.stopRoutineOnDayOffs) {
  final currentWeekday = selectedDate.weekday; // 1=Monday, 7=Sunday
  if (widget.dayOffs.contains(currentWeekday)) {
    // This is a day-off and the setting is ON - hide all routine actions
    displayActions.clear();
  }
}
```

### 📊 Data Flow
1. **User Setup:** User selects day-offs (Mon=1, Sun=7) and toggles "Stop Routine on Day-offs" setting
2. **Settings Storage:** Setting saved to SharedPreferences as `stopRoutineOnDayOffs` boolean
3. **Timeline Display:** When displaying any day's timeline, check if:
   - Setting is ON (`widget.stopRoutineOnDayOffs == true`)  
   - Current day is in day-offs set (`widget.dayOffs.contains(currentWeekday)`)
4. **Action Filtering:** If both conditions are true, clear all `displayActions` 
5. **UI Result:** Timeline shows empty state on day-off days

### 🎛️ Settings Integration
- **Settings Tab:** SwitchListTile with title "Stop Routine on Day-offs"
- **Subtitle:** "Do not show any routine actions on selected Day-offs"
- **Persistence:** Automatically saved to SharedPreferences when toggled
- **Loading:** Restored from SharedPreferences on app startup

### 📅 Day-off Selection
- **UI Component:** FilterChips for each weekday (Mon-Sun)  
- **Selection:** Multiple days can be selected as day-offs
- **Visual Feedback:** Selected days highlighted with filter chip styling
- **Data Structure:** `Set<int>` where 1=Monday, 7=Sunday

## 🚀 USAGE SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Weekend Day-offs
```
Selected Day-offs: Saturday (6), Sunday (7)
Setting: Stop Routine on Day-offs = ON
Result: No routine actions shown on Sat/Sun
```

### Scenario 2: Custom Work Schedule
```
Selected Day-offs: Wednesday (3), Friday (5)  
Setting: Stop Routine on Day-offs = ON
Result: No routine actions shown on Wed/Fri
```

### Scenario 3: Setting OFF (Default)
```
Selected Day-offs: Any days
Setting: Stop Routine on Day-offs = OFF
Result: Routine actions shown on all days (normal behavior)
```

## 🔄 INTERACTION WITH OTHER FEATURES

### ✅ Compatible Features
- **Templates System:** Day-offs work with both custom routines and templates
- **Repeat Weekdays:** Day-off logic applies even if weekday routine is repeated
- **Date Navigation:** Day-offs apply when navigating to past/future dates
- **Schedule Modes:** Works with all schedule modes (Daily, Weekly)

### ⚠️ Design Decision
**All Actions Hidden:** When day-off + setting ON, ALL actions are cleared including:
- User routine actions ✅ Hidden
- Template actions ✅ Hidden  
- Schedule times (wake/sleep/meals) ✅ Hidden

*Alternative approach could preserve schedule times, but current implementation provides complete "day off" experience*

## 🧪 TESTING VERIFICATION

### Manual Test Cases
1. ✅ **Enable Setting:** Toggle ON → Navigate to day-off → Verify empty timeline
2. ✅ **Disable Setting:** Toggle OFF → Navigate to day-off → Verify actions visible  
3. ✅ **Multiple Day-offs:** Select multiple days → Verify all hidden when setting ON
4. ✅ **Persistence:** Restart app → Verify setting and day-offs restored correctly
5. ✅ **Template Interaction:** Apply template → Navigate to day-off → Verify hidden

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ **No Day-offs Selected:** Setting ON but no days selected → No effect (normal behavior)
- ✅ **All Days Selected:** All 7 days as day-offs → All days show empty timeline
- ✅ **Date Navigation:** Navigate between day-off and normal days → Proper filtering
- ✅ **Setting Toggle:** Real-time toggle → Immediate UI update
