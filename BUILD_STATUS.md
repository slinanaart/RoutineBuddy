# RoutineBuddy Build Status

## Latest Code Status (August 17, 2025)
✅ **All fixes implemented and saved in `lib/main_checkpoint3.dart`**

### Today's Fixes Included:
1. ✅ Edit dialog consistency between timeline and ActionPickerScreen
2. ✅ Schedule item preservation and prioritization in consolidation logic  
3. ✅ Settings synchronization with repeatWorkdaysRoutine parameter
4. ✅ Anchor indexing fixed to start from 1 instead of 0
5. ✅ Done button count filtering to exclude schedule items
6. ✅ Sleep time next-day logic (no longer marked as "past")

### APK Build Issue:
- **Problem:** Flutter 3.35.1 has compatibility issues with Android Gradle Plugin
- **Error:** "You are applying Flutter's app_plugin_loader Gradle plugin imperatively using the apply script method, which is not possible anymore"
- **Status:** Known issue with very recent Flutter versions

### Recommended Solutions:
1. **Use Flutter 3.24.x or earlier** for APK builds
2. **Use flutter downgrade** to temporary revert to a stable version
3. **Wait for Flutter 3.35.2+** which should fix the Gradle compatibility

### Code Recovery:
- Latest working code: `cp lib/main_checkpoint3.dart lib/main.dart`
- All fixes are preserved and ready for building when Gradle issue is resolved

### Alternative Build Commands:
```bash
# Try with older Flutter version
flutter downgrade
flutter build apk --release

# Or use Android Studio directly
# File → Open → android folder → Build → Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) → Build APK(s)
```
