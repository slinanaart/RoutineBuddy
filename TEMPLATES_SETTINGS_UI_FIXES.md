# Templates Tab & Settings UI Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Restored and Repositioned "Create your own routine" Option
**Issue**: Templates tab was missing the "Create your own routine" option
**Solution**: Added the missing ListTile to TemplatesTab class and moved it to the top:
```dart
Card(
  child: ListTile(
    leading: CircleAvatar(backgroundColor: Color(0xFF3B82F6), child: Icon(Icons.edit_calendar_outlined, color: Colors.white)),
    title: Text('Create your own routine'),
    subtitle: Text('Set your anchors and build your own timeline'),
    onTap: () => Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => ManualSetupScreen())),
  ),
),
```

**Template Order**: 
1. **Create your own routine** (Blue, custom timeline)
2. The Casual (Free, balanced routine)
3. The Professional (Locked, work-focused)
4. The Athlete (Locked, fitness-first)

### 2. Reduced Day-off Box Padding
**Issue**: Settings day-off boxes had too much padding from text to box edge
**Solution**: Reduced `labelPadding` from `horizontal: 8` to `horizontal: 4` in both:
- Settings tab FilterChips
- Manual Setup screen FilterChips

## Files Modified
- `lib/main_checkpoint8_final.dart`
  - Added missing template option to TemplatesTab
  - Moved "Create your own routine" to top position
  - Reduced FilterChip labelPadding for tighter day-off boxes

## Result
✅ "Create your own routine" option now at top of Templates tab  
✅ Day-off selection boxes have tighter padding (text closer to edge)  
✅ Consistent across both Settings tab and Manual Setup screens  
✅ Better user flow - custom routine creation is primary action

## Status
Ready for testing - changes applied to running app.
