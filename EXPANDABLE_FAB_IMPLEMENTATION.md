# Expandable FAB Implementation - Test Report

## Feature Overview
Successfully implemented an expandable FAB (Floating Action Button) with two option bubbles:
- **Add Action** â†’ Opens the Action Picker (positioned above FAB)
- **Create Event** â†’ Opens calendar dialog for one-time events (positioned to left of FAB)

## Implementation Details

### 1. ExpandableFAB Widget
- **Animation**: Smooth 300ms expansion/collapse with easing curve
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Main FAB rotates 45Â° and changes icon (+ â†’ Ã—) when expanded
  - Semi-transparent overlay when expanded for easy dismissal
  - Scale and fade animations for option bubbles
- **Position**: Option bubbles positioned strategically to avoid overlap

### 2. Option Bubbles Design
- **Add Action**: Icon `playlist_add`, positioned 80px above FAB
- **Create Event**: Icon `event`, positioned 80px to the left of FAB
- **Styling**: Rounded labels with shadows, consistent with Material Design
- **Interaction**: Tap to execute action and auto-collapse

### 3. Create Event Dialog
- **Form Fields**: 
  - Event Name (required text input with validation)
  - Date picker (from today up to 1 year ahead)
  - Time picker (standard Material time selector)
- **Validation**: Ensures event name is not empty
- **UX**: Auto-focus on name field, clear cancel/create actions

### 4. Event Integration
- **Storage**: Events stored in `daySpecificActions` with unique identifiers
- **Display**: Events show with ðŸ“… prefix for easy recognition
- **Sorting**: Events integrated into timeline and sorted chronologically
- **Feedback**: Success snackbar confirms event creation
- **Persistence**: Events persist across app sessions

## Technical Implementation

### Animation System
```dart
AnimationController + CurvedAnimation
- Duration: 300ms
- Curve: Curves.easeInOut
- Transform.translate for positioning
- Transform.scale + Opacity for smooth appearance
```

### Event Data Structure
```dart
{
  'name': 'ðŸ“… Event Name',
  'time': TimeOfDay,
  'category': 'event',
  'isUserAction': true,
  'isCustomEvent': true,
  'frequency': 1,
}
```

### Hero Tag Management
- Unique hero tags prevent animation conflicts between multiple FABs
- Each option button gets unique identifier based on label

## User Experience Flow

### 1. FAB Expansion
1. User taps main FAB (+ icon)
2. FAB rotates 45Â° and shows Ã— icon
3. Two option bubbles animate in smoothly
4. Background overlay appears for easy dismissal

### 2. Add Action Flow
1. User taps "Add Action" bubble
2. Options collapse immediately
3. Action Picker opens with existing functionality
4. Selected actions integrate normally into timeline

### 3. Create Event Flow
1. User taps "Create Event" bubble
2. Options collapse immediately
3. Create Event dialog opens
4. User fills: Name, Date, Time
5. Validation ensures complete data
6. Event added to timeline at correct chronological position
7. Success feedback via snackbar

### 4. Dismissal Methods
- Tap main FAB (Ã— icon) to collapse
- Tap background overlay to collapse
- Select any option (auto-collapse)
- System back gesture (auto-collapse)
