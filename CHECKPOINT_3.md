# RoutineBuddy Checkpoint 3 - Enhanced Timeline Implementation

## Date: August 16, 2025

## Summary
Enhanced the timeline with drag-and-drop functionality, grey-out for past actions, and live time updates during dragging.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Vertical Timeline
- **Vertical timeline with time indicators**: Shows time slots from wake to bed time
- **Past action grey-out**: Actions before current time are greyed out and non-interactive
- **Live drag functionality**: Actions can be dragged to new times with real-time preview
- **Minute-level precision**: Time updates snap to minute resolution during drag

### 2. Drag and Drop Features
- **Long-press to drag**: Actions can be long-pressed and dragged to new times
- **Live time preview**: Shows floating time badge during drag operation
- **Time calculation**: Dragging up decreases time, dragging down increases time
- **Auto-sort on drop**: Timeline automatically re-sorts after dropping an action
- **Smooth animations**: Visual feedback during drag operations

### 3. Timeline Visual Design
- **Clean card-based layout**: Uses the preferred UI from checkpoint 2
- **Time indicators**: Shows hour markers and current time position
- **Category color coding**: Different colors for different action categories
- **Frequency indicators**: Shows frequency count for actions with multiple occurrences per day

### 4. Current Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Vertical timeline layout with checkpoint 2 UI
- ‚úÖ Drag and drop functionality implemented
- ‚úÖ Past action grey-out logic
- ‚úÖ Live time updates during drag
- ‚úÖ Minute-level time snapping
- ‚úÖ Auto-sort after drop
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Needs testing in browser

## Technical Details

### Core Components
1. **RoutineTab**: Enhanced stateful widget managing timeline state
2. **_DraggableTimelineItem**: Custom draggable widget for timeline actions
3. **_buildVerticalTimeline**: Method that builds the vertical timeline with drag support

### Key Methods
- `_buildVerticalTimeline()`: Creates the vertical timeline layout
- `_isActionInPast()`: Determines if action time has passed
- `_calculateTimeFromPosition()`: Converts drag position to time
- `_updateActionTime()`: Updates action time and re-sorts timeline

### File Locations
- Main implementation: `lib/main.dart`
- Backup at checkpoint 2: `lib/test_main_checkpoint2.dart`
- Previous checkpoint: `lib/test_main_checkpoint1.dart`

## Features Added Since Checkpoint 2
1. **Past Action Detection**: Actions with time < current time are greyed out
2. **Drag and Drop**: Long-press drag to reorder and change times
3. **Live Time Updates**: Real-time time calculation during drag
4. **Visual Feedback**: Floating time badge and smooth animations
5. **Enhanced Timeline**: Better visual hierarchy and time indicators

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Start fresh Flutter session: `flutter run -d chrome`
2. Test drag and drop functionality
3. Verify past action grey-out
4. Test live time updates during drag
5. Confirm auto-sorting after drop

## Recovery Instructions
To restore this implementation:
```bash
cd /Users/vanha/Proj/250814_routinebuddy_0.0.0.1
cp lib/main.dart lib/main_backup.dart  # backup current
# The enhanced timeline is already in lib/main.dart
flutter run -d chrome
```

To rollback to checkpoint 2:
```bash
cp lib/test_main_checkpoint2.dart lib/main.dart
```

## Implementation Notes
- Uses checkpoint 2's clean UI design as requested
- Maintains all previous functionality (settings, action picker, navigation)
- Enhanced with drag-and-drop and time-based visual states
- Responsive to current time for realistic day progression
- Minute-level precision for accurate scheduling

## Code Status
- ‚úÖ Compilation successful (no errors)
- ‚úÖ All methods implemented
- ‚úÖ UI enhancements complete
- üîÑ Ready for browser testing

This checkpoint preserves the enhanced timeline implementation combining checkpoint 2's preferred UI with the new drag-and-drop and time-aware features.
