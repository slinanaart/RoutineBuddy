# Recovery Checkpoint 2 - Timeline Action Editing + Vertical Timeline

## Date: August 16, 2025
## Status: Stable Implementation with Vertical Timeline and Drag-Drop

### Features Implemented in Checkpoint 2:

#### 1. Timeline Action Editing ✅
- **Clickable Timeline Cards**: Timeline action cards are now clickable and open an edit dialog
- **Time & Frequency Editing**: Users can edit both time and frequency for actions in the timeline
- **Frequency-based Anchor Distribution**: Actions with frequency > 1 are distributed as equally-spaced anchors from wake to bed time
- **Real-time UI Updates**: Changes are immediately reflected in the timeline with proper state management

#### 2. Vertical Timeline Layout ✅
- **ReorderableListView**: Implemented drag-and-drop reordering of timeline actions
- **Custom Timeline Items**: Visual timeline with time indicators and action cards
- **Time-based Sorting**: Actions automatically sort by time after reordering

#### 3. Enhanced RoutineActionCard ✅
- **Frequency Display**: Cards now show frequency information (e.g., "3x per day") when frequency > 1
- **Updated Constructor**: Added required frequency parameter with proper display logic
- **Visual Improvements**: Better subtitle layout with frequency information

#### 3. Stateful Timeline Management ✅
- **Converted RoutineTab**: Changed from StatelessWidget to StatefulWidget for proper state management
- **Local State Management**: Timeline actions are managed locally with setState for immediate updates
- **Action Synchronization**: Proper synchronization between parent data and local edits

#### 4. Timeline Action Edit Dialog ✅
- **Time Picker Integration**: Easy time selection with native time picker
- **Frequency Input**: Number input field for setting action frequency
- **Save/Cancel Actions**: Proper dialog handling with action callbacks

#### 5. Anchor Distribution Algorithm ✅
- **Intelligent Spacing**: High-frequency actions are distributed evenly across the day
- **Wake-to-Bed Calculation**: Uses wake and bed times to calculate optimal anchor points
- **Automatic Naming**: Actions are numbered (e.g., "Exercise 1/3", "Exercise 2/3")
- **Time Sorting**: Timeline automatically sorts actions by time after anchor distribution

### Technical Details:

#### Core Components:
- `RoutineTab` (StatefulWidget): Main timeline container with state management
- `_RoutineTabState`: Handles local action state and editing logic
- `RoutineActionCard`: Enhanced card component with frequency display
- `_TimelineActionEditDialog`: Modal dialog for editing action properties
- `_TimelineActionEditDialogState`: Dialog state management for time and frequency

#### Key Methods:
- `_editTimelineAction()`: Opens edit dialog and handles save callbacks
- `_distributeActionWithAnchors()`: Implements frequency-based anchor distribution
- `_initializeDisplayActions()`: Initializes local state from parent data

#### Data Flow:
1. Parent passes routineActions to RoutineTab
2. RoutineTab initializes local displayActions state
3. User taps on timeline card to edit
4. Edit dialog modifies local state with setState
5. Timeline immediately reflects changes

### All Previous Features Maintained:
- Settings screen with wake/bed times, meal management, day-offs toggle
- Action Picker with category/time/day filters and card-based editing
- Navigation flow from first screen through settings to action picker to routine tab
- Auto-selection after editing actions
- Recovery checkpoint system

### File Status:
- **lib/test_main.dart**: 1360+ lines, fully functional with timeline editing
- **CHECKPOINT_1.md**: Previous recovery documentation
- **lib/test_main_checkpoint1.dart**: Backup of previous stable state

### Recovery Instructions:
If needed, restore this checkpoint by:
1. Copy current lib/test_main.dart to backup: `cp lib/test_main.dart lib/test_main_backup.dart`
2. This current implementation is the stable checkpoint 2 state
3. All features tested and working in Chrome browser
4. Timeline editing tested with frequency distribution

### Browser Testing Status:
- ✅ Chrome deployment working on http://127.0.0.1:* (port varies)
- ✅ Timeline cards clickable and responsive
- ✅ Edit dialog opens and functions properly
- ✅ Frequency-based anchor distribution working
- ✅ Real-time timeline updates confirmed
- ✅ All navigation flows working

### Next Iteration Opportunities:
- Vertical timeline visualization with time strings
- Drag and drop reordering functionality
- Timeline visual enhancements (time markers, visual connections)
- Persistence of timeline edits
- Advanced anchor distribution options
