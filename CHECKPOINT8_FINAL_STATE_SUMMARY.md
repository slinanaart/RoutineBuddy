# CHECKPOINT 8 - Final State Summary

## Date: August 28, 2025

## Current Status
This checkpoint captures the final state of RoutineBuddy after all major implementations and improvements.

## Key Features Implemented
- ✅ Expandable FAB with proper event handling
- ✅ Timeline anchor interactions and routing
- ✅ Drag handle improvements
- ✅ Action picker enhancements
- ✅ Emoji icon system
- ✅ Multi-anchor routing fixes
- ✅ UI cleanup and refinements
- ✅ Performance optimizations

## Recent Bug Fixes
- ✅ **FIXED**: Missing frequency indicator in template preview screen
  - Issue: Frequency indicators (toggle switches showing "Nx/day") were not displaying in the Casual template preview
  - Solution: Restored the complete frequency indicator implementation in `main_checkpoint7.dart` line 714-730
  - The frequency indicators now properly show blue badges with sync icons for actions with frequency > 1

- ✅ **UPDATED**: The Casual Template CSV action names and details
  - Issue: Action names in CSV file were generic (e.g., "Light stretch" vs "Breathing exercise (10 min)")
  - Solution: Updated the CSV file to match the provided detailed action names with specific durations and descriptions
  - Changes include:
    - More specific exercise names (e.g., "Breathing exercise (10 min)" for Thursday)
    - Detailed action descriptions (e.g., "Drink a full glass of water" vs "Drink a glass of water")  
    - Activity-specific names (e.g., "Short meditation (10 mins)" vs "Short walk" for Monday)
    - Proper hobby/leisure descriptions (e.g., "Self-care time" vs "Self time")
    - Mobility-focused activities (e.g., "Mobility routine (focus joints)" for Friday)
  - File updated: `/Users/vanha/Proj/RoutineBuddy/assets/data/The_Casual_Template.csv`

- ✅ **FIXED**: "Apply template for the day" workflow in Routine tab
  - Issue: Clicking "Apply template for the day" directly applied The Casual template without showing template selection
  - Solution: Added template selection dialog that matches the Templates tab interface
  - Now shows template list → user selects template → confirmation dialog → applies selected template
  - Uses CSV file data for proper template loading with anchor spreading and frequency settings
  - Added `_showTemplateSelectionDialog()` and `_applySelectedTemplate()` methods in `main_checkpoint7.dart`
