# Tomorrow's Work Checklist - RoutineBuddy

## Recovery Instructions
If needed, restore from checkpoint: `cp lib/main_checkpoint3.dart lib/main.dart`

## Priority Issues to Check:

### 1. Action Filter ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] ‚úÖ **Verify action filtering** functionality in ActionPickerScreen
- [x] ‚úÖ **Test category-based filtering** (ensure all categories work properly)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Check search/filter performance** optimization
- [x] ‚úÖ **Added search suggestions** with lightweight dropdown
- [x] ‚úÖ **Fixed gray screen bug** with improved null-safe sorting
- [x] ‚úÖ **Default sort by Recommended Time** instead of Category

### 2. Settings Tab Synchronization
- [ ] **Check settings tab sync** - ensure settings properly save/load
- [ ] **Verify repeatWorkdaysRoutine parameter** flow between screens
- [ ] **Test settings persistence** across app restarts

### 3. Day-off Routine Logic
- [ ] **Implement/verify day-off routine** functionality 
- [ ] **Test weekend vs weekday** routine switching
- [ ] **Ensure proper schedule handling** for non-work days

### 4. Timeline Display Issues
- [ ] **Review timeline formatting** consistency
- [ ] **Check time format** consistency (00:00 vs 12:00 AM)
- [ ] **Verify action name display** in timeline

### üÜï Action Picker Improvements ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY
- [x] ‚úÖ **Category sorter**: Default sort by Recommended Time, fixed gray screen bug
- [x] ‚úÖ **Search box**: Added type-ahead suggestions (lightweight dropdown)
- [x] ‚úÖ **Action card click**: Removed trailing edit icon, tap anywhere to open dialog
- [x] ‚úÖ **Edit frequency dialog**: Fixed text overflow with Wrap, corrected grammar ("1 time" vs "x times")
- [x] ‚úÖ **Exclude schedule-type actions**: Schedule items no longer appear in picker

### üìù Improvements Made Details:
1. **Fixed Gray Screen Bug**: Added null-safe sorting with try-catch fallback
2. **Default Time Sorting**: Sort by Morning‚ÜíAfternoon‚ÜíEvening, then by actual time
3. **Search Suggestions**: Google-like dropdown with action names and categories (max 5 results)
4. **Cleaner Action Cards**: Removed edit icon, entire card is clickable
5. **Better Frequency Dialog**: Fixed grammar and text wrapping issues
6. **Schedule Exclusion**: Only free actions appear in picker, not wake/sleep/meal times

## Recently Fixed Issues (Verified Working):
‚úÖ Edit dialog consistency between timeline and ActionPickerScreen  
‚úÖ Schedule item preservation and prioritization in consolidation logic  
‚úÖ Settings synchronization with repeatWorkdaysRoutine parameter  
‚úÖ Anchor indexing fixed to start from 1 instead of 0  
‚úÖ Done button count filtering to exclude schedule items  
‚úÖ Sleep time next-day logic (no longer marked as "past")  

## Additional Areas to Monitor:

### UI/UX Consistency
- [ ] Dialog styling consistency across all screens
- [ ] Material 3 design compliance
- [ ] Responsive layout behavior

### State Management
- [ ] Action state synchronization between screens
- [ ] Timeline consolidation logic stability
- [ ] Memory management and performance

### Time Logic
- [ ] Next-day time calculations accuracy
- [ ] Anchor time distribution algorithm
- [ ] Sleep/wake time edge cases

### Data Persistence
- [ ] Action frequency updates
- [ ] Category preservation
- [ ] Settings storage reliability

## Technical Context:
- Flutter 3.35.1 web application
- Current checkpoint: `main_checkpoint3.dart`
- Key functions: `formatTimeCustom()`, `_isActionPast()`, `_getNonScheduleActionCount()`
- Enhanced consolidation logic with schedule item preservation
- 1-based anchor indexing system
- Simplified next-day sleep time logic

## Testing Protocol:
1. Start app: `flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8085`
2. Test action addition/editing flow
3. Verify timeline display and state consistency
4. Check settings synchronization
5. Test edge cases (sleep time, anchor distribution)

## Known Working Features:
- Action editing with consistent dialog styling
- Schedule item prioritization in timeline
- Next-day sleep time handling
- Anchor distribution starting from 1
- Done button accurate counting
- Settings parameter flow
