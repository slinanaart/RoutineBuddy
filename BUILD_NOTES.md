# Build Notes for v0.0.0.4

## Current Issues Fixed for Next Build:

### ❌ Issue with v0.0.0.4:
- **App Name:** Shows as "temp_build_project" instead of "RoutineBuddy"  
- **Launcher Icon:** Missing custom launcher icons
- **Cause:** Fresh Flutter project used default configuration

### ✅ Fixed for v0.0.0.5:
Updated `build_apk.sh` to properly copy:
1. **AndroidManifest.xml** with correct app label "RoutineBuddy"
2. **Launcher icons** from `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*` folders
3. **All Android resources** to ensure proper branding

### Next Build Will Include:
- ✅ Proper app name: "RoutineBuddy"
- ✅ Custom launcher icons
- ✅ All checkpoint3 features
- ✅ Correct package name: com.example.routine_buddy

### Current APK Status:
- **File:** `250817-rb-apk-ver0.0.0.4.apk`
- **Functionality:** ✅ All features work perfectly
- **Branding:** ❌ Default name and icon (will be fixed in v0.0.0.5)

---
*Note: v0.0.0.4 contains all the code improvements but has cosmetic branding issues that will be resolved in the next build.*
