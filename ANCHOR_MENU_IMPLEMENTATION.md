# Anchor Menu Implementation Summary

## What was implemented
Added a popup menu to timeline anchor cards with Delete and Duplicate functionality.

## Files changed
- `lib/main_checkpoint4.dart` - Initial implementation with popup menu and helper methods
- `lib/main.dart` - Applied same changes to the main entry point used by `flutter run`

## UI Changes
- Added PopupMenuButton to the right side of anchor cards (next to drag handle)
- Menu appears only for actions with `anchorIndex` property
- Two menu options: "Delete this anchor" and "Duplicate this anchor"

## Functionality Added

### Delete Anchor (`_deleteAnchorAt(index)`)
- Removes the specific anchor instance from `displayActions`
- Finds all other anchors of the same action (by name+category)
- Recomputes `anchorIndex` and `totalAnchors` for remaining anchors
- Re-sorts timeline by time order

### Duplicate Anchor (`_duplicateAnchorAt(index)`)
- Creates a copy of the anchor and inserts it after the current one
- Recomputes `anchorIndex` and `totalAnchors` for all anchors of that action
- Re-sorts timeline by time order

## Testing Status
✅ App compiles and runs successfully in Chrome
✅ No compilation errors
⏳ Manual testing needed to verify menu appears on anchor cards

## How to Test
1. App is running in Chrome (via `flutter run -d chrome`)
2. Navigate to Routine tab
3. Add actions with frequency > 1 to create anchored actions
4. Look for three-dot menu on anchor cards (shows anchor index like "1/3", "2/3")
5. Test Delete and Duplicate functionality

## Next Steps Options
- Apply same changes to other checkpoint files if needed
- Add persistence to save anchor changes to SharedPreferences
- Add visual feedback/animations for anchor operations
- Add tests for anchor manipulation functions
