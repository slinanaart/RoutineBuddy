# ✅ CHECKPOINT 7 - STATE SUCCESSFULLY SAVED
**Timestamp: August 27, 2025**

## 📁 **Saved Files**
- ✅ `lib/main_checkpoint7.dart` - Complete implementation with all features
- ✅ `lib/main_checkpoint7_backup.dart` - Backup of previous state  
- ✅ `CHECKPOINT7_FINAL_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed feature documentation
- ✅ `lib/main.dart` - Clean wrapper pointing to checkpoint

## 🎯 **Checkpoint 7 Features Confirmed**

### **✅ Per-day Multi-functional Menu**
- Icon: `Icons.menu_open` (distinctive from kebab menu)
- Location: Header row, after next day button  
- Options: "Clear this day" & "Apply template for the day"
- Persistence: SharedPreferences integration
- UX: Confirmation dialogs for user safety

### **✅ UI Polish Complete**  
- Round FAB at bottom-right (only on Routine tab)
- GlobalKey architecture for HomeScreen ↔ RoutineTab communication
- Clean separation of concerns
- No background interference with timeline

### **✅ Cleared-day Persistence**
- `clearedDays` static map for runtime tracking
- SharedPreferences with `'cleared:$dayKey'` format
- Prevents auto-repopulation of intentionally cleared days
- Methods: `_setClearedDay()`, `_isDayCleared()`

## 🔧 **Technical Status**
- **Build**: ✅ Compiles without errors
- **Runtime**: ✅ Launches successfully in Chrome
- **Architecture**: ✅ Clean, maintainable structure
- **Performance**: ✅ No regressions from previous checkpoint

## 🚀 **Ready for Production**
All user requirements have been implemented and tested:
1. ✅ Per-day menu with distinct icon
2. ✅ Cleared-day persistence 
3. ✅ Round FAB with proper positioning
4. ✅ Full timeline and template functionality
5. ✅ Drag-and-drop reordering
6. ✅ SharedPreferences persistence

## 📋 **Usage Instructions**
To run from this checkpoint:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```
The app will load `lib/main.dart` → `lib/main_checkpoint7.dart` → Full App

**Checkpoint 7 is complete and production-ready! 🎉**
