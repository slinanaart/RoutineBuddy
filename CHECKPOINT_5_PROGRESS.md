# Checkpoint 5 - Action Picker State Preservation Progress

## Current Status (August 18, 2025)

### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Chrome Testing & Deployment** - Successfully running on Chrome browser
2. **Settings Persistence** - Settings saved across sessions
3. **Schedule Mode Implementation** - Weekly/Daily modes with automatic anchor creation
4. **Interactive Timeline** - Drag & drop reordering, chronological sorting
5. **Complete Repeat Functionality Removal** - Eliminated all duplication issues
6. **Independent Day Storage System** - Each day stores actions separately using `daySpecificActions` Map
7. **First-time Setup Handling** - Proper initialization for new users
8. **Permanent Schedule Anchors** - Wake time, meal times, bed time always appear
9. **Chronological Timeline Ordering** - Actions sorted by time (06:00 → 06:15 → 06:30...)
10. **Sleep Time Positioning Fix** - Sleep (00:00) correctly positioned at bottom of timeline
11. **Duplicate Schedule Item Elimination** - Removed schedule items from action picker parameters

### 🔧 Current Issue Being Resolved
**Action Picker State Preservation**: Actions are being saved correctly and display properly in timeline, but when reopening the action picker, previously selected actions don't show as checked/selected.

### 📊 Technical Architecture
- **Main File**: `lib/main_checkpoint3.dart` (4011 lines)
- **Day Storage**: `static Map<String, List<Map<String, dynamic>>> daySpecificActions`
- **Timeline Sorting**: Chronological order with special sleep handling (00:00 treated as 24:00)
- **Action Categories**: Schedule items vs User actions properly separated
- **State Management**: Independent day storage with proper isolation

### 🐛 Debug Status
- Enhanced debug logging added for action picker flow
- Debug messages show:
  - Actions being passed to action picker
  - Actions returned from action picker
  - Storage operations
  - Timeline rebuilding process

### 💡 Recent Changes Made
1. **Simplified Action Picker Parameter Logic**: Instead of complex consolidation from `displayActions`, now directly pass saved user actions from `daySpecificActions[dayKey]`
2. **Enhanced Debug Output**: Added clear success/failure messages for action picker operations
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Added debug for cases where action picker returns null/wrong format

### 🔄 Next Steps to Complete
1. **Fix Action Picker State Preservation**: Ensure previously selected actions appear as checked when action picker reopens
2. **Verify End-to-End Workflow**: Complete action selection → save → reopen → verify state preservation
3. **Final Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all features together

### 📁 Key Code Locations
- **Action Picker Button**: Lines ~2580-2610 (simplified parameter passing)
- **Action Saving Logic**: Lines ~2610-2650 (day storage and timeline rebuild)
- **Timeline Sorting**: Lines ~2650-2700 (chronological order with sleep handling)
- **Day Storage System**: `daySpecificActions` static Map for independent day storage
- **Schedule Mode Actions**: `_addScheduleModeActions()` method for permanent anchors

### 🎯 Success Criteria
- [x] Actions save correctly to day storage
- [x] Timeline displays actions properly in chronological order
- [x] No action duplication between days
- [x] Schedule items appear correctly (wake, meals, sleep)
- [ ] Action picker shows previously selected actions as checked ← **Current Focus**

### 🔍 Debug Test Instructions
1. Go to "Manually Creating Routine"
2. Complete settings screen
3. Click "Add Actions" → Select actions → Done
4. Check terminal/console for debug messages:
   - `DEBUG: *** ACTION PICKER SUCCESS ***` (if actions returned)
   - `DEBUG: *** NO ACTIONS RETURNED ***` (if no actions returned)
5. Click "Add Actions" again → Previously selected actions should be checked

## Code Quality
- No compilation errors
- Clean architecture with separated concerns
- Comprehensive debug logging
- Independent day storage prevents cross-day contamination
- Proper state management with immediate UI updates

## Summary
Major architectural improvements completed with independent day storage system, chronological timeline ordering, and elimination of all duplication issues. Currently resolving the final piece: action picker state preservation to ensure previously selected actions appear as checked when the picker is reopened.
