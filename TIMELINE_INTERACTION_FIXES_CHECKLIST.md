# Timeline Interaction Fixes - Comprehensive Implementation

## Task: Timeline interaction fixes (past items, wake/sleep rules, duplicate/delete logic, persistence)
**Date Started:** August 22, 2025
**Status:** In Progress

### Requirements Breakdown:

1. **Drag/Menus for Past Items & Wake/Sleep** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - ‚úÖ Implement `isPastAnchor()` helper function
   - ‚úÖ Implement `isWakeOrSleep()` helper function
   - ‚úÖ Hide drag handle for past anchors (today's past items only)
   - ‚úÖ Hide drag handle for Wake/Sleep (completely non-draggable)
   - ‚úÖ Hide popup menu for past anchors and Wake/Sleep
   - ‚úÖ Allow Wake/Sleep time adjustment via tap (time picker)

#### 2. "More" and Drag Handle Positions (UI) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Move "more" button further to top-right, aligned to right edge
- ‚úÖ Move drag handle further to bottom-right, aligned to right edge
- ‚úÖ Ensure no overlap, keep 12-16px padding from edges
- ‚úÖ Add offset positioning to PopupMenuButton (left/down alignment)
- ‚úÖ Improve PopupMenu shape with rounded corners
- ‚úÖ Increase elevation for better visual separation
- ‚úÖ Improve menu item icons and spacing
- ‚úÖ Better touch target sizes for menu items
- **Implementation Notes:** Improved PopupMenuButton with offset positioning, better styling, and enhanced menu items
- **Test Scenarios:** Menu positioning should be better aligned and more touch-friendly

#### 3. Live Time Preview While Dragging üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- ‚è≥ Recompute virtual time continuously from Y-position during drag
- [ ] Show recalculated time in time chip during drag
- [ ] Apply final time after midpoint rule on drop
- [ ] No "past" locks for non-today plans
- **Implementation Notes:**
- **Test Scenarios:**

#### 4. Duplicate Logic Fix (No More Default 06:00 Bug) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Increase originalFrequency by +1 for action group on that day
- ‚úÖ Redistribute anchors evenly from "current anchor time or now" to Sleep
- ‚úÖ Skip past minutes only if editing TODAY
- ‚úÖ Recompute anchorIndex = 1..N, totalAnchors = N
- ‚úÖ Fix bug where duplicates reset to 06:00
- **Implementation Notes:** Implemented `_redistributeAnchorGroupEvenly()` method that properly distributes anchor times from wake/now to sleep, avoiding 06:00 defaults
- **Test Scenarios:** Duplicate any anchor - should distribute evenly in time range, no 06:00 resets

#### 5. Delete Logic + Reindex ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Decrease group's originalFrequency by 1 on delete
- ‚úÖ Recompute indices 1..N with no gaps in chronological order
- ‚úÖ Evenly redistribute remaining anchors in [wake, sleep]
- ‚úÖ If only one anchor left and deleted ‚Üí uncheck in ActionPicker, reset to defaults
- **Implementation Notes:** Enhanced delete logic uses same `_redistributeAnchorGroupEvenly()` method to reindex and redistribute remaining anchors
- **Test Scenarios:** Delete anchors from groups - remaining should reindex 1,2,3... with even time distribution

#### 6. Midpoint on Drop + Group Rules ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Assign dropped anchor midpoint time between neighbors (next-day aware)
- ‚úÖ Apply anchor group rules (maintain group integrity during moves)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced _calculateMidpointTime with next-day logic
- ‚úÖ Individual anchor moves with group order maintenance
- **Implementation Notes:** Enhanced `_updateTimesAfterReorder()` with better midpoint calculation and group rules. Group anchors maintain their relative positioning and can be individually moved while preserving group integrity
- **Test Scenarios:** Drag anchors between positions - should calculate proper midpoint times, handle next-day boundary cases

#### 7. Persistence Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Save all duplicate/delete/drag changes to daySpecificActions
- ‚úÖ Sync to SharedPreferences timeline storage
- ‚úÖ Ensure persistence after all timeline modifications
- ‚úÖ Debug logging for storage operations
- **Implementation Notes:** Added `_persistCurrentTimeline()` method that updates both memory storage (daySpecificActions) and SharedPreferences with JSON encoding. Called after duplicate, delete, and redistribution operations
- **Test Scenarios:** Make timeline changes, navigate away/back - changes should persist

#### 7. Schedule Items Protection ‚ùå
- [ ] Wake, Meals, Sleep, Review: no duplicate/delete
- [ ] Wake & Sleep: non-draggable
- [ ] Time adjustment via time chip for schedule items
- [ ] Clamp within [00:00..29:59 next-day], maintain wake-sleep window invariant
- [ ] Meal anchors: allow time adjust on anchor only
- **Implementation Notes:**
- **Test Scenarios:**

#### 8. Persistence Bug (Edits Disappearing on Navigation) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Persist per-day timeline immediately on change
- ‚úÖ Key: `timeline:<yyyy-MM-dd>`  
- ‚úÖ Save full day list (including group meta) to storage
- ‚úÖ On day load, don't regenerate from template if saved timeline exists
- ‚úÖ Ensure saving on setState completion (addPostFrameCallback)
- **Implementation Notes:** Implemented `_persistCurrentTimeline()` called after all timeline modifications (duplicate, delete, drag). Saves to both daySpecificActions memory storage and SharedPreferences with proper JSON encoding
- **Test Scenarios:** Make changes, navigate to different day and back - changes should persist

#### 9. Only Block "Past" for TODAY ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Past-time lock applies only when editing today
- ‚úÖ Tomorrow/future days ‚Üí fully draggable (except Wake/Sleep restrictions)
- ‚úÖ "Can't move anchor to past" snackbar only for today
- **Implementation Notes:** Already correctly implemented with `isEditingToday = _isSameDay(selectedDate, now)` check before applying past-time restrictions
- **Test Scenarios:** Edit tomorrow's timeline - should allow dragging to any time; edit today - should block past times

#### 10. Sorting & Clamping ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Sort with _compareTimesWithNextDay after any change
- ‚úÖ Clamp all anchors in [wake..sleep-5min]
- ‚úÖ Recalculate group indicators (i/N)
- **Implementation Notes:** Enhanced `_sortAndClampAllActions()` with proper clamping to wake..sleep-5min bounds and added `_recalculateAnchorGroupIndicators()` to maintain correct chronological anchor indices
- **Test Scenarios:** Make timeline changes - actions should be sorted chronologically with proper anchor indices 1,2,3...

#### 11. UI Polish ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Align kebab and drag handle to right edge
- ‚úÖ Disabled anchors: opacity ~0.5, disable interactions
- ‚úÖ Frequency indicator chip (i/N) visible for multi-anchors  
- ‚úÖ Schedule items: show small lock icon for protected items
- **Implementation Notes:** Added lock icon for schedule items, proper opacity handling for disabled actions, improved kebab/drag positioning from earlier tasks
- **Test Scenarios:** UI should show lock icons on schedule items, proper opacity on disabled items, clean right-aligned positioning

#### 9. Only Block "Past" for TODAY ‚ùå
- [ ] Past-time lock applies only when editing today
- [ ] Tomorrow/future days ‚Üí fully draggable (except Wake/Sleep restrictions)
- [ ] "Can't move anchor to past" snackbar only for today
- **Implementation Notes:**
- **Test Scenarios:**

#### 10. Sorting & Clamping ‚ùå
- [ ] Sort with _compareTimesWithNextDay after any change
- [ ] Clamp all anchors in [wake..sleep-5min]
- [ ] Recalculate group indicators (i/N)
- **Implementation Notes:**
- **Test Scenarios:**

#### 11. UI Polish ‚ùå
- [ ] Align kebab and drag handle to right edge
- [ ] Disabled anchors: opacity ~0.5, disable interactions
- [ ] Frequency indicator chip (i/N) visible for multi-anchors
- [ ] Schedule items: show small lock icon for protected items
- **Implementation Notes:**
- **Test Scenarios:**

#### 12. Debug Logs ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Log drag start/move/drop with computed times
- ‚úÖ Log duplicate/delete with new frequency & indices
- ‚úÖ Log save/load of per-day timeline cache
- **Implementation Notes:** Enhanced debug logging throughout drag operations (start time, computed target time, final drop time), duplicate operations (original time, new frequency, redistribution), delete operations (group frequency changes), and persistence operations (save/load confirmations)
- **Test Scenarios:** All timeline interactions should show comprehensive debug output in console
