User Feedback: Previous v2 icon perceived as "hideous"; request for design similar to provided reference (rounded gradient square, white minimal clock + check mark integration).

Response Adjustments:
- Replaced circular badge + smile motif with integrated check mark forming part of routine metaphor.
- Adopted teal gradient close to reference (lighter top-left, deeper bottom-right) for calm + productivity feel.
- Simplified interior to high-contrast strokes; removed small decorative nodes for clarity at small sizes.
- Provided maskable and monochrome variants with stroke weight adjustments for legibility.

Next Possible Tweaks:
1. Fine-tune arc openness (currently ends near ~210Â° to transition into check) if more circular continuity wanted.
2. Adjust gradient hues to match any evolving brand palette tokens.
3. Add subtle inner shadow or noise texture (optional) if depth desired.
4. Produce dark-mode inverted variant if launcher theme adaptive icons required.

Status: Ready for export pipeline (see ICON_EXPORT_TASKS.md). If accepted, integrate via flutter_launcher_icons config.
