# RoutineBuddy Icon Iteration Notes

Goal: Create a distinctive, clean, modern icon that represents time + structure + helpful assistance.

Core Motifs Considered:
- Clock + anchor dots (routine checkpoints)
- Layered arcs (progression through the day)
- Buddy mark (subtle companion shape w/ smile)
- Gradient core with accent ring

Next Version Goals:
1. Higher contrast at small sizes
2. Simplify interior detail (avoid tiny tick marks)
3. Use 2–3 primary colors + 1 accent
4. Preserve circular balance (friendly) but add subtle forward motion

Proposed Palette:
- Primary Teal: #0FA3A5
- Deep Teal: #075A5B
- Warm Accent (Sun / Energy): #FFB648
- Soft Neutral Base: #F5FDFD

Concept Structure:
- Outer ring (deep teal) = boundary/structure
- Inner gradient disk (teal → light) = calm focus
- Three orbiting checkpoint nodes = routine anchors
- Central upward arc smile = positive buddy/help
- Minimal clock hands (hour+minute) set to 10:10 (open welcoming)

Deliverables:
- master SVG (512x512)
- simplified maskable variant (flat shapes)
- monochrome fallback
